# Web Design Principles
This repo summarizes the web design knowledge I acquired in the [Get into Tech course by INCO Academy](https://www.inco.org.au/get-into-tech). The course is much richer than web design alone, but since the capstone project was a webpage and I was lucky to have as fascilitator [a UX Designer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalia-bornay/), I decided to showcase here some of my work.

For this project I focused in the UX/UI, did some user testing, and iterated based on the knowledge acquired. I used a website builder for the code not to get in the way of my learning. Later, I would apply these same concepts in my website [Alone in the Sea](https://aloneinthesea.com/), where I also write the code of the site.
